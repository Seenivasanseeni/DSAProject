This is my Project Work for my DSA PROJECT 
It allows a user to enter a data into a AVL Tree and it shows  rotations (if any) . It uses turbo c . i used it in order to minimize it my time in doing the project. 
So i cant be sitting in fron of opengl or any other graphics. 
If anyone need to use AVL Tree Simulation , there are welcome  to get it , modify and even use it for their academic purposes.
They are welcome to commit changes over here, so that any platform can run this code.
Happy Working with Data Structures and AVL Tree
